Hi, I'm Gabi, the guy behind the sheep (not in that way, you sick bastard) and this is my small creature set out to make the world a better place.

I've got a degree in computer science and a certificate in electric guitar. Sometimes I play computers, sometimes I program musical instruments. And when I don't, I usually go biking mountains.
