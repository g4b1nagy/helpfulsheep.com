That being said, I am available for freelance web development work. I've done a lot of different things over the years, from conference websites to [real time maps](https://ctf365.com/pages/map) and from medical apps to [real estate search engines](http://nemutam.co/) so if it moves on the web and it's not a spider, chances are I can give you a hand.

An avid GNU/Linux user, I'm very fluent in Python and JavaScript. I love writing backend code almost as much as developing clean UIs so yes, I can definitely LESS the browser compatibility out of your CSS.
